# AngularStorybookChromaticCDD

```js
// create new angular project
ng new Angular-Storybook-Chromatic-CDD

// Initialize Storybook in your project
npx sb init
```

## Up to this point, we should have

- Angular App running:
localhost:4200

- StoryBook running:
localhost:6006

- Chromatic running:
https://www.chromatic.com/start

- Setup a new project in a Repo (I used gitHub)
Then `Choose your Project` from Chromatic and select the repo:
https://github.com/leolanese/Angular-Storybook-Chromatic-CDD

## Publish Angular-Storybook-Chromatic-CDDâ€™s Storybook

```js
// Get the Chromatic package
npm install --save-dev chromatic

// Publish your Storybook (using your token provied by Chromatic)
npx chromatic --project-token=chpt_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

// No 'chromatic' script found in your package.json
// selection 'Y' to add in the package.json
// "chromatic": "npx chromatic --project-token=chpt_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

## Back to chromatic.com
Now,  you should see a new published Storybook

## Getting into Action!
Now Click: `Catch a UI change` to Spot UI changes

```js
//  src/stories/Header.components

git add --all ; git commit -m 'Modified Header for testing' ; git push
```
